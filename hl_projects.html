									<h2>Counts, Coverage, and Transitions</h2>
									<p>I currently work as a pre-doctoral research fellow for the <a href="https://cid.harris.uchicago.edu/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive Income Dataset Project</a> under professors Bruce Meyer and Angela Wyse using restricted administrative microdata to explore US homelessness. The first of the two projects I'm working on uses Census microdata to check the count of people experiencing homelessness and coverage of homeless service facilities by the 2020 Decennial against the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's annual homeless Point-in-Time and Housing Inventory counts. We are also comparing the 2010-2020 longitudinal trends in US homelessness as reported by the two sources.</p>
									<p>The second project links individuals in the 2010 and 2020 Decennials, as well as the 2006-2023 American Community Surveys, to compute transitional probabilities between housing situations. For example, what is the probability that someone in a state prison in 2010 transitions to experiencing unsheltered homelessness in 2020? How do these transition probabilities vary by year, housing situation, geography, demographics?</p>

									<h2>Asylum Seekers and the Rise in Homelessnes</h2>
									<p>Data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicate an unprecedented 43 percent increase in the number of people residing in homeless shelters in the United States between 2022 and 2024, reversing the gradual decline over the preceding sixteen years. Three-quarters of this rise was concentrated in four localities – New York City, Chicago, Massachusetts, and Denver – where large inflows of new immigrants seeking asylum were housed in emergency shelters. Using direct estimates from local government sources and indirect methods based on demographic changes, we estimate that asylum seekers accounted for about 60 percent of the two-year rise in sheltered homelessness during this period, challenging media and policy narratives that primarily attribute this rise to local economic conditions and housing affordability.</p>
									<p>This paper extends my senior thesis analysis to new 2024 HUD homeless count data and Massachusetts statewide family shelter estimates. It has a conditional acceptance from the Journal of Public Economics, and our working paper was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research at <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a></p>.

									<h2>Disaggregating National Trends in Homelessness</h2>
									<p>Between January 2022 and January 2023, the estimated homeless population in the United States increased 12% from 582,462 to 653,104. This is not only the largest increase in US homelessness on record in the new millennium, it also brings the highest estimated homeless population since 2007. In this work, we disaggregate this increase to the local level to discover the subpopulation trends it is composed of. Namely, an influx of South and Central American asylum seekers arriving in New York City, Chicago, and Denver nearly doubled the 2022-2023 increase and the 7 year growth trend in chronic unsheltered homelessness along the West Coast is steadily increasing annual counts. We recommend legal clinics to expedite the work permit and moving process for asylum seekers, coordinated landlord outreach and moving events for newly employed asylum seekers, and geographic redistribution of homeless asylum seekers to counties with more shelter capacity.</p>
									<p>I wrote this senior thesis with the guidance of my advisors professors Bruce Meyer and Angela Wyse. It can be read at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11BJvO1UKOAByTAp4pAtvvQwMCymUiC8VDuma5MCMS78/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> and won the UChicago Stone Center Thesis Award in Public Policy. I would also like to modify the discussion on unsheltered trends in this work. While the aggregate 2022-2024 unsheltered trend appears to be a continutaion of the post-2015 trend, it actually marks a stark shift. From 2014-2020, unsheltered homelessness increased dramatically in California and offset a decreasing trend in the rest of the country. From 2022-2024 this geographic trend reversed: unsheltered homelessness remained stable in California and went up everyehere else.</p>
