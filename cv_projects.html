									<h2>Cook County Property Valuation Modeling</h2>
									<p>Every year, the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) must estimate the market value of every property in the Chicago metropolitan area to assign and collect ~$18 billion in annual property taxes. With millions of properties, it is impossible to send an assessor to every apartment, condo, office, and house in the county; instead they train predictive models using property sales data to estimate these values. In December 2024, I presented <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EP8sLyLJovzmcBPxRfL2a8jEqHcMOSte/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101967645695696199105&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these slides</a> to the CCAO team. The presentation explored the model's pre-COVID accuracy bias and methods to measure and adjust for this bias. Afterwards, I was asked about ways to simplify their condominium valuation model which has a severe lack of unit-level features in its training data. I suggested training a residual model to predict the difference between a running average of building sales values weighted by recency and the known sales values.</p>
									<p>Over the following two months I met multiple times with the team to evalaute test results and CCAO ended up implementing the <a href="https://github.com/ccao-data/model-condo-avm/issues/73#issue-2751457413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">condominium residual model</a> to estimate all condo market values. After testing it was discovered that the data lacked the necessary covariates to deal with the pre-COVID accuracy bias, but my variance and bias detection figures have been integrated into the residential model evaluation pipeline.</p>

									<h2>Particle Collision Simulation</h2>
									<p>Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN use very computationally expensive monte-carlo methods to simulate the energy shower resulting from a high speed particle collision as detected by an array of sensors around the collision chamber called a calorimeter. These simulations are used as the baseline for comparison when searching for novel behavior in collision experiments but are a huge budget and time bottleneck for particle accelerator research. The <a href="https://calochallenge.github.io/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge</a> was launched to try and find new, more efficient ways to simulate these calorimeter showers. I worked with a a team of undergrads and two physicists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to design and test new simulations using generative AI techniques (latent diffusion and consistency distillation models).</p>
									<p>Our work narrowed down the range of potential model architectures which can accurately simulate these calorimeter showers and found that consistency distillation, while initially promising, ultimately could not meet the desired level of accuracy. We also won the Data Science Clinic Project of the Year award! A summary of some of our latent diffusion work can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QRAcLrhzag5w0LPRXEV99_DsUn782Yvo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112100786871011141237&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these slides</a>. I designed tested the consistency model myself and submitted it for my computer vision class final project, the write-up can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Douglasmsw/CaloConsistency/blob/main/Computer_Vision_Final_Project.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> and is in a repo with my code which is forked from our latent diffusion repo.</p>

									<h2>3D Mesh Editing</h2>
									<p>In undergrad I was part of the <a href="https://3dl.cs.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3DL computer graphics and deep learning lab</a>, where I investigated ways to edit the shape and color of a digitally represented 3D object (mesh) using image or text prompts. I ended up leading a project called TextR3Mesh, which sought to iteratively edit and reparameterize a mesh using a combination of deep learning and geometry algorithms. Unfortunately, I was unable to get consistent results before the CVPR conference submission deadline my senior year and then I turned my attention to my senior thesis on homelessness.</p>
									<p>Although I left the project to fizzle out, it was a lot of fun and I learned a ton from the experience and incredible mentorship of my PI Rana Hanocka! The unfinished paper write up, which includes some images of results and a description of our method, can be found <a href="TextR3Mesh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

									<h2>Semantically Aware 3D Environment Reconstruction</h2>
									<p>When an autonomous drone enters a new environment it must understand its surroundings to navigate safely and effectively. But to understand its environment it must explore, requiring safe navigation. This dual problem has spawned a family of algorithms called SLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. One branch of these algorithms look to reconstruct the environment in 3D while exploring using images captured by a camera and use visually distinct landmarks to get a fix on location. Because this reconstruction is occuring live during exploration, the speed at which it can accurately reconstruct the environment is crucial. For my final project in my Robotic Planning, Learning, and Estimation class, I and another classmate looked to tackle this problem using semantic information about the environment.</p>
									<p>In order to speed up environment reconstruction from images, we ran the captured images through OpenAI's CLIP model, which embeds them in a joint text-image semantic space. In (something closer to) english, we passed the images through an AI model which returned a vector (or list) of numbers that numerically represented the semantic information in the image. For example, pictures of chairs return similar vectors of numbers which are all very different from what's returned for pictures of squids. By injecting this additional semantic information into the training process for the model reconstructing the environment, we were able to reconstruct more accurately with fewer images. Our write-up (and code in the repo) can be found <a href="https://github.com/Douglasmsw/DAD_SLAM/blob/master/PAPER_Semantic_Neural_Mapping.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

									<h2>Political Polarization and the Judiciary</h2>
									<p>After we realized the supreme court was going to overturn Roe v. Wade in May 2022, I heard lots of conversations about the political extremity of the judiciary, a <em>supossedly</em> neutral branch of government. I decided to investigate this question of judicial partisanship through political polarization among Article III federal judges. These judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate. If the pool of eligible judges were more polarized but the senate was not, the senate would select a less polarized federal judge pool. But if the senate was polarized, regardless of the polarization of the eligible judges, they will take opportunities to select more politically extreme judges.</p>
									<p>My write-up can be found <a href="https://github.com/Douglasmsw/Political-Polarization-In-the-Judiciary/blob/main/Judge_Polarization_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I used two datasets which assigned a score to every congressperson and judge respectively, which reflected their political leaning (left vs right) relative to their peers serving at the same time. These scores were calculated using their voting / ruling history and political contributions. I then designed a statistic measuring how polarized congress or the federal judge pool is for any given congress. Finally, I used regression analysis to test the degree of association between senate and judicial political polarization. In short, political polarization has increased significantly over the last 60 years, and federal judge polarization has followed. There is a discussion to be had about proximate causes of senate polarization but the data clearly shows it has leaked into the judiciary.</p>
