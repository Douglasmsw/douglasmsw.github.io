									<h2>Cook County Property Valuation Modeling</h2>
									<p>Every year, the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) must estimate the market value of every property in the Chicago metropolitan area to assign and collect ~$18 billion in annual property taxes. With millions of properties, it is impossible to send an assessor to every apartment, condo, office, and house in the county; instead they train predictive models using property sales data to estimate these values. In December 2024, I presented <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EP8sLyLJovzmcBPxRfL2a8jEqHcMOSte/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101967645695696199105&rtpof=true&sd=true">these slides</a> to the CCAO team. The presentation covered the model's pre-COVID accuracy bias and methods to adjust for this bias. Afterwards, I was asked about ways to simplify their condominium valuation model which has a severe lack of unit-level features in its training data. I suggested training a residual model to predict the difference between a running average of building sales values weighted by recency and the known sales values.</p>
									<p>Over the following two months I met multiple times with the team to evalaute test results and CCAO ended up implementing the <a href="https://github.com/ccao-data/model-condo-avm/issues/73#issue-2751457413">condominium residual model</a> to estimate all condo market values. After testing it was discovered that the data lacked the necessary covariates to deal with the pre-COVID accuracy bias, but my variance and bias figures have been integrated into the residential model evaluation pipeline.</p>

									<h2>Particle Collision Simulation</h2>
									<p>Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN use very computationally expensive monte-carlo methods to simulate the energy shower resulting from a high energy collision as detected by an array of sensors around the collision chamber called a calorimeter. These simulations are used as the baseline for comparison when searching for novel behavior in a collision experiment. The <a href="https://calochallenge.github.io/homepage/">Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge</a> was launched to try and find new, more efficient ways to simulate these calorimeter showers. I worked with a a team of undergrads and two physicists at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory to design and test new simulations using generative AI techniques (letent diffusion and consistency / distillation models).</p>
									<p>Our work narrowed down the range of potential model architectures which can accurately simulate these calorimeter showers and found that consistency distillation, while initially promising, ultimately could not meet the desired level of accuracy. We also won the Data Science Clinic Project of the Year award! A summary of some of our latent diffusion work can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QRAcLrhzag5w0LPRXEV99_DsUn782Yvo/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112100786871011141237&rtpof=true&sd=true">these slides</a>. I tested the consistency model myself and submitted it for my computer vision class final project, the write-up can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Douglasmsw/CaloConsistency/blob/main/Computer_Vision_Final_Project.pdf">this link</a> and is in a repo with my code which is forked from our latent diffusion repo.</p>

									<h2>3D Mesh Editing</h2>
									<p>In udndergrad I was part of the <a href="https://3dl.cs.uchicago.edu/">3DL computer graphics and deep learning lab</a> where I investigated ways to edit the shape and color of a digitally represented 3D object (mesh) using image or text prompts. I ended up leading a project called TextR3Mesh, which sought to iteratively edit and reparameterize a mesh using a combination of deep learning and geometry algorithms. Unfortunately, I was unable to get consistent results before the CVPR conference submission deadline my senior year and then I turned my attention to my senior thesis on homelessness.</p>
									<p>Although I left the project to fizzle out, it was a lot of fun and I learned a ton from the experience and incredible mentorship of my PI Rana Hanocka! The unfinished paper write up, which includes some images of results and a description of our method, can be found <a href="TextR3Mesh.pdf">here</a>.</p>
